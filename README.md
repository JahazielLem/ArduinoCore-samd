The Electronic Cats SAM D|L|C Core for Arduino is a fork from MattairTech/ArduinoCore-samd
on GitHub, which will be used to maintain Arduino support for Electronic Cats boards.

### Microcontroller supported

- SAMD21
- SAML21
- SAMC21
- SAMD11
- SAMR34 or RAK4260
- SAMD51

### SAMD (ARM Cortex-M0+) Boards by Electronic Cats
* Supports all board by Electronic Cats
* Supports four clock sources (two crystals, internal oscillator, and USB calibrated).
* Supports the bootloaders UF2. Available at [bootloaders UF2 SAMD21 repository](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/uf2-samd21).
* USB CDC Bootloader with optional SDCard support. See [bootloaders/zero/README.md](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/ArduinoCore-samd/tree/master/bootloaders/zero/README.md).

## Installation Instructions "Electronic Cats" support

**Instructions Details**

More details about Installation Instruction visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/ArduinoCore-samd/wiki/Installation-Instruction)

**Simple Install**

To add board support for our products, start Arduino and open the Preferences window (**File** > **Preferences**). Now copy and paste the following URL into the 'Additional Boards Manager URLs' input field:

## Differences Between Electronic Cats and Arduino Cores

* Communications interfaces are mostly unchanged, including USB
* All pins have high drive strength enabled by default
* All pins (digital and analog) setup in STARTUP mode (enable INEN and set default pull direction to pullup (pullup will not be enabled))
* INEN enabled for both input and output (but not analog)
* pinPeripheral now handles disabling the DAC (if active). Note that on the L21, the DAC output would
  interfere with other peripherals if left enabled, even if the anaolog peripheral is not selected.
* Pull resistors enabled only if pin attributes allow and only if pin is not configured as output.
* Pull direction (pullup or pulldown) is now set with pinMode only (defaults to pullup if pinMode never called).
* At least on the L21, pin A31 must be set as an input. It is possible that debugger probe detection is being falsely
  detected (even with a pullup on A31 (SWCLK)), which would change the peripheral mux of A31 to COM.
  This might not normally be a problem, but one strange effect is that Serial2 loses characters if pin A31 is not set as INPUT.
  So, the startup code calls pinMode(31, INPUT).
* Todo: Table summarizing which core files are modified and by how much
* Todo: List changes due to adding/changing features vs porting to new chip
* Added support for SAMR34
* Added support for Electronic Cats Boards
* Remove Mattairtech Boards
* Update with Arduino Core official fix
* Remove menu for SPI, Serial and I2C interfaces
* Thanks Mattairtech!

### API Core

 All Features and Configuration for the Core is available in [APICore.md](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/ArduinoCore-samd/blob/master/APICore.md)

### Features

* SAM-BA USB CDC and UART interfaces with optional terminal mode
* SD Card interface (both USB CDC and SD Card support fits in 8KB)
* Four different clock sources (two external crystals and two internal oscillator options)
* Arduino IDE auto-reset and double-tap reset button support
* Arduino extended commands for faster firmware loading
* Supports the SAM D51, D21, L21, C21, R34 and D11.
* Bossac command line utility for Windows, Linux, and OS X

The bootloader can be started by:

   * Tapping reset twice in quick succession (BOOT_DOUBLE_TAP).
   * Holding down button A (BOOT_LOAD_PIN) while powering up.
   * Clicking 'Upload Sketch' in the Arduino IDE, which will automatically start the bootloader (when CDC is enabled).
   * If the application (sketch) area is blank, the bootloader will run.

Otherwise, it jumps to application and starts execution from there. The LED will PWM fade during bootloader execution.

### Special Libraries for this Core

- [ArduinoLowPower fork of Arduino](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/ArduinoLowPower)
- [RTCZero fork of Arduino](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/RTCZero)

### Bossac

Bossac is a command line utility for uploading firmware to SAM-BA bootloaders. It runs on Windows. Linux, and OS X.
It is used by Arduino to upload firmware to SAM and SAMD boards. The version described here adds to the
Arduino version (https://github.com/shumatech/BOSSA, Arduino branch), which in turn is a fork from the original
Bossa (http://www.shumatech.com/web/products/bossa). It adds support for more SAM chips (D51, D21, L21, C21, and D11),
support for four clock sources, and firmware loading from a MicroSD card.


### Bootloader Firmware Installation

[Instructions for Bootloader Firmware Installation](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/ArduinoCore-samd/wiki/Bootloader-Firmware-Installation)

### Bootloader Binaries

The [bootloaders UF2 SAMD21 repository](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/uf2-samd21) repository contains the UF2
bootloaders from the 'Electronic Cats SAM D|L|C Core for Arduino', which is
available at https://github.com/ElectronicCats/uf2-samd21.
